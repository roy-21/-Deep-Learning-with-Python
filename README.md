# Deep Learning with Python (Keras & TensorFlow)

This repository contains my complete hands-on journey through Deep Learning with Python by Jason Brownlee, using Keras and TensorFlow. It includes practical deep learning projects covering MLP, CNN, RNN, NLP, time series forecasting, regularization, hyperparameter tuning, and more. Real-world datasets like Iris, Sonar, Pima Indians Diabetes, and MNIST are used. Each chapter features organized code, exercises, and project-based learning.
